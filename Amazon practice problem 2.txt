Explanation for the architecture for practice problem 2

First divide the DB(database) to multiple DBs

We devide business logic into 3 layers

 - Data Access Object(DAO)
   This layer queries the DB. It can be implemented as a interface(API like)
   And each DB will have it's own implementation for the DAO, so queries will be successfully made.
   This layer handles overall communication between the DB and the Business logic

 - Service Layer
   This layer process the data retrieved from the DB to a format to something that Logic layer can use
   For instance, if we want to know the address of the customer, service layer makes multiple calls to the
   Data access object, and from the retrieved queries, filters out the needed information(address in this case).
   We can make multiple calls if the required data is distributed in multiple DBs

 - Logic Layer(Business Logic from the simplest architecture from the example)
   This layer is the handles the business logic. Simple layer that is the web service itself.

By dividing business logic to 3 different layers(more like adding two other layers into a existing one),
this architecture will be scalable(by adding more DBs to distribute the traffic on each DB), 
and avaliable(since we use REST, the burden of traffic will be only applied to the DB queries).
